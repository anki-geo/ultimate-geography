# Translation sources

This file clarifies which sources have been used for translations and which style choices have been made for each language.

## Norwegian bokmål (nb)

Norwegian bokmål is the preferred written language of 90 % of Norway's population, 
the remaining 10 % preferring Norwegian nynorsk (nn).

The Norwegian bokmål translation has been based on a few sources in addition to the English and German decks, listed in order of priority:

- **The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' brochure ["Statsnavn, hovedsteder og nasjonaldager" ("Country names, capitals and national holidays")](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/statsnavn-hovedsteder-og-nasjonaldager/id87863/)**:
  This brochure is as close to an authoritative source of country names in Norwegian as is possible, as it is used as a guide for Norwegian diplomats. Only includes sovereign countries.
- **[The Great Norwegian Encyclopedia (Store norske leksikon)](https://snl.no/)**: A Norwegian language encyclopedia edited by experts. This has been used for countries and territories which were not included above.
- **[Wikipedia in Norwegian bokmål](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Forside)**: Used whenever neither of the above sources were enough to verify spelling.

In matters of style and grammar, a somewhat conservative style has been used, with feminine gendered nouns used only in the case of bays and islands ("-bukta" and "-øya", e.g. Biscayabukta instead of Biscayabukten).

## Spanish (es)

The Spanish translation has been based on the following sources in addition to the English deck, in order of priority:

- **[Wikipedia in Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Portada)**: Used because it follows a very good style guide based on official sources and trying to be as neutral as possible, regarding how extended is Spanish in the world.
