## Images

The flags (`ug-flag-...`), with the exception of the ones listed below, are sourced from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/), where they are released into the **public domain**. Most are listed on Wikipedia's [Gallery of sovereign state flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign_state_flags). I did not make any visual modification, but did optimise them with [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) and [PNGGauntlet](https://pnggauntlet.com/) to reduce file size.

Most of the maps are also sourced from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/). They are part of the German [Locator map](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Kartenwerkstatt/Positionskarten) project of Wikipedia's [Map workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Graphics_Lab/Map_workshop). More specifically, they are 500px-wide PNG versions of SVG locator maps from the project's [16:9 regional location map scheme](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_locator_maps_(16:9_regional_location_map_scheme)), and are released under the **[CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)** licence.

### Licence unknown

The licence of the following maps is unknown at this time:

- Maps of the water bodies (seas, gulfs, etc.), except for all the Oceans, the Bay of Biscay, the Bering Strait, the Celtic Sea, the Denmark Strait, the East Siberian Sea, the English Channel, the Gulf of Mexico, the Hudson Bay, the Labrador Sea and the White Sea (see above).
- Maps of Corsica, Galapagos Islands, Kaliningrad Oblast, Sardinia and Zanzibar.

I will endeavour to [replace these maps](https://github.com/axelboc/anki-ultimate-geography/issues/2) with ones I know are open source, but in the meantime, if you absolutely want to know where they come from, I invite you to use Google's [reverse image search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en) or to search through [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/).
