## Images

The sources and licenses of the flags (`ug-flag-...`) and maps (`ug-map-...`) in the `media` folder are listed in `sources.csv`. The following licenses are referenced in the _License_ column:

- [CC BY-SA 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/)
- [CC BY-SA 2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/)
- [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)
- [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
- [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
- [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
- [PD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) (public domain)

`sources.csv` references only the licenses of the files themselves. Some flags, like the [European Union flag](https://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/the-european-flag#column-5), may come with additional copyright retrictions.

A question mark in the _Source_ column indicates that the source and license of an image are unknown. Effort is being made to replace such images (cf. issue #1).

All images have been optimised, resized and/or converted to reduce file size. Any further modifications are listed in the  _Modifications_ column.
