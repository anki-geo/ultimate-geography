## Images

The flags (`ug-flag-...`), with the exception of the ones listed below, are sourced from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/), where they are released into the **public domain**. Most are listed on Wikipedia's [Gallery of sovereign state flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign_state_flags). I did not make any visual modification, but did optimise them with [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) and [PNGGauntlet](https://pnggauntlet.com/) to reduce file size.

Most of the maps are also sourced from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/). They are part of the German [Locator map](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Kartenwerkstatt/Positionskarten) project of Wikipedia's [Map workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Graphics_Lab/Map_workshop). More specifically, they are 500px-wide PNG versions of SVG locator maps from the project's [16:9 regional location map scheme](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_locator_maps_(16:9_regional_location_map_scheme)), and are released under the **[CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)** licence.

### Exceptions

- The flags of [Afghanistan](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Afghanistan.svg) (`ug-flag-mauritania.svg`) and [Mauritania](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Mauritania.svg) (`ug-flag-mauritania.svg`), as well as the [maps of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Island](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_locator_maps_of_countries_in_the_United_Kingdom_(location_map_scheme)) are released under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en).
- The maps of [Saint Helena](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St_Helena-Pos.png) (`ug-map-saint_helena.png`), [Java](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Java_Locator.svg) (`ug-map-java.png`), [Mount Athos](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Athos_in_Greece.svg) (`ug-map-mount_athos.png`), and of the [seven continents](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_locator_maps_of_continents_(location_map_scheme)_(Winkel_3_projection)) (`ug-map-africa`, `ug-map-antartica`, `ug-map-asia`, `ug-map-europe`, `ug-map-north_america`, `ug-map-oceania`, `ug-map-south_america`) are released under **[CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)**.
- The [map of the Balkan Peninsula](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Balkan_Peninsula.svg) (`ug-map-balkan_peninsula.png`) was cropped in order to remove its legend. The original version is released under **[CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)**; therefore, this version is as well.
- The [flag of Northern Cyprus](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus.svg) (`ug-flag-northern_cyprus.svg`) is released under [CC-BY-SA 2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/deed.en).

### Licence unknown

The licence of the following maps is unknown at this time:

- Maps of water bodies (oceans, seas, gulfs, etc.)
- Maps of Azores, Ceuta, Corsica, Galapagos Islands, Kaliningrad Oblast, Melanesia, Melilla, Micronesia, Polynesia, Sardinia, Sumatra and Zanzibar.

I will endeavour to [replace these maps](https://github.com/axelboc/anki-ultimate-geography/issues/1) with ones I know are open source, but in the meantime, if you absolutely want to know where they come from, I invite you to use Google's [reverse image search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en) or to search through [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/).
